User Feedback Form for LaunchDarkly

Structure of the HTML Document

The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration for HTML5. The `<head>` section contains metadata and the page title. The `<body>` section is organized into semantic elements for better readability and accessibility.

Form and Input Elements

The feedback form includes fields for name, email, satisfaction rating (radio buttons), a dropdown for feature selection, and a textarea for additional comments. A submit button is included to send the form data.

Page Layout and Navigation

The page uses semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`. The navigation bar contains links to placeholder sections of the employee portal.

Embedded Media

A tutorial video and an audio notification sound are embedded using the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements, both with playback controls. Placeholder URLs are used for now.

Validation and Accessibility

The form uses HTML5 validation attributes like `required` and `maxlength`. Labels are associated with input fields for accessibility, and the page structure follows a logical flow.
