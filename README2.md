The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to define it as an HTML5 document.  

Inside the `<head>` section:  
The `<meta>` tags set character encoding and viewport settings for responsiveness.  
The `<title>` tag provides a meaningful title: "Welcome to LaunchDarkly."  

Inside the `<body>` section:  
The `<h1>` tag is used for the main title.  
An `<h2>` tag introduces the "Our Mission and Values" section, followed by a `<p>` tag describing LaunchDarklyâ€™s mission.  
Another `<h2>` tag introduces the "Core Values" section, followed by an unordered list (`<ul>`) of three key values.  
A hyperlink (`<a>`) provides a way to learn more about LaunchDarkly.  
An `<img>` tag displays a placeholder image, with an `alt` attribute for accessibility.  

Challenges and Solutions  

Understanding the required structure  
Ensured that each HTML element served a clear purpose by following best practices for headings, lists, and accessibility.  

This assignment provided a great foundation for working with basic HTML structure, and I look forward to building more complex interfaces in the future.
